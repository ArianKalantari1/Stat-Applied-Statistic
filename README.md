# Stat-Applied-Statistic

This unit aims to extend and broaden statistical experience from STAT6170, with a focus on application to real-world analysis. It covers relationships between categorical or continuous explanatory variables and a continuous response variable using the techniques of one-way and two-way analysis of variance and simple and multiple linear regression. Data management, report writing, graphical presentation of results, and power analysis are described.
